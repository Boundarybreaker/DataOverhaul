Data Overhaul adds a recipe template system to drastically cut down on the number of JSON files a modder has to write without adding any required code calls.

TODO:
- [ ] ~~Figure out how to deal with stone bricks (inject name into template name somehow? difficult with limited identifier symbols)~~ added opt-out system
- [ ] ~~Remove vanilla recipes for ones added through templates (should be irrelevant if name injection is doable)~~ added opt-out system
- [ ] Other data overhauls (extensions onto tags, template advancements to match template recipes)
- [ ] Proper documentation
